# Problem 1 Week 1

## Problem: 
Jim owns a donut shop that sells 8 colours of donuts that each cost a different amount. The colours and their respective costs are red ($5.55), green ($2.25), orange ($3.36), purple ($4.77), black ($4.95), white ($3.23), brown ($4.44) and yellow ($3.00). Jim wants you to create a console/command line program (Python, Node JS, C++, C whatever you want really), that allows users to create a shopping cart with any number of items in it as well as a checkout sequence. The checkout sequence should print the sum of all the items cost with HST included, which is 13%.

## Some hints for this problem:
1. Arrays and dictionaries are your best friend
2. **Recurse, recurse, recurse!**
3. Floats are better than integers for this problem.
4. Donâ€™t forget to convert from string to float and from float to string.
